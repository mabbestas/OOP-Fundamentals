## What is OOP?
Object-oriented programming is one of the most important programming paradigms. It is a system of principles that define what basic logic we use to solve a given task and to structure our programs, and how elements of the code are connected to each other.

## Advantages of OOP
* It is easier to model complex things as simpler, more reproducible structures
* The code is easily reusable
* We can create programs that run faster with it
* The structure of the code is more transparent
* Development is faster because parallel classes can be developed at the same time
* The program can be modified, debugged, and maintained easier
* It is safer (encapsulation and abstraction makes data more secure)
