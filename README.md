# OOP-Fundamentals

## What is OOP?
Object-oriented programming is one of the most important programming paradigms. It is a system of principles that define what basic logic we use to solve a given task and to structure our programs, and how elements of the code are connected to each other.

## Advantages of OOP
* It is easier to model complex things as simpler, more reproducible structures
* The code is easily reusable
* We can create programs that run faster with it
* The structure of the code is more transparent
* Development is faster because parallel classes can be developed at the same time
* The program can be modified, debugged, and maintained easier
* It is safer (encapsulation and abstraction makes data more secure) 

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding. 
* Encapsulation solves it implementation level.
* Encapsulation means binding the code and data into a single unit.
* Encapsulation means hiding the internal details or mechanics of how an object does something for security reasons.

## Inheritance


## Abstraction
The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users. Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the object to the user. It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts.
* Abstraction in Object Oriented Programming solves the issues at the design level.
* Abstraction in Programming is about hiding unwanted details while showing most essential information.
* An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
* It does not support multiple inheritances.
* It can provide the implementation of the interface.
* An abstract class can have protected and abstract public methods.
* An abstract class can have final, static, or static final variable with any access specifier.

## Interface
An interface is a completely “abstract class” that is used to group related methods with empty bodies. Interface defines what operations a class can perform. An interface declares the properties and methods. It is up to the class to define exactly what the method will do.
* The interface can have only abstract methods.
* It supports multiple inheritances.
* It can not provide the implementation of the abstract class.
* An interface can have only have public abstract methods.
* The interface can only have a public static final variable.
* The enhancement will become very easy because we can change our internal implementation without affecting the outside person.
